Rules:
- Extract the exception name or message keyword and set Query.Keyword.
- Convert natural language time to absolute UTC ISO8601 using {{TIMEZONE}}; set Query.From and Query.To.
- Normalize service/environment when possible.
- Default Query.Levels to ["error"] unless user requests otherwise; map requested severities to Levels.
- Populate Query fields when available: From, To, Environment, ServiceNames, Host, Levels, Keywords, Tags (as Dictionary<string,string>) and Limit.
- Default Query.Limit to 5 if unspecified. Default Source is Datadog (omit Source field).
- Output strictly as LogQueryCaseParams with a single property "Query".
- Do not set default values for Environment, ServiceNames, or Host; only populate them when explicitly mentioned by the user, otherwise omit.
